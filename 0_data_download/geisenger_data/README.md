Directions are as follows:

"I’ve attached two files. The first is a file of hg38 coordinates for the target genes. If there are any that are missing or incorrect, please add or fix in using the same format so I can repull the variants. The second file contains the unique moderate and high impact variants in the target genes. The columns are chr, pos, ref, alt, gene, and transcript id. The impact of the variants was called based on the transcript id.
 
I suggest that you annotate this files with an flag indicating if it should be included as a positive variant and the target gene (matching the name in your file of association results). When you return it to me, I’ll check to see how many individuals have gene combinations that match your study in the UKB. Let me know if this makes sense."
