# Genes from Locke paper https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14177

# I will use Table 1, Table 2, and Extendended Data Table 2 as the set of signficant BMI-associated genes discovered by Locke and Colleagues:

	# "Our primary meta-analysis of European-descent individuals from GWAS and Metabochip studies (n = 322,154) identified 77 loci reaching genome-wide significance (GWS) and separated by at least 500 kilobases (kb) (Table 1, Extended Data Table 2 and Supplementary Figs 1 and 2). We carried out additional analyses to explore the effects of power and heterogeneity. The inclusion of 17,072 non-European-descent individuals (total n = 339,224) identified ten more loci, while secondary analyses identified another ten GWS loci (Table 2, Supplementary Tables 4–8 and Supplementary Figs 3–9). Of the 97 BMI-associated loci, 41 have previously been associated with one or more obesity measure5,8,9,10,11,12. Thus, our current analyses identified 56 novel loci associated with BMI (Tables 1 and 2 and Extended Data Table 2)."
