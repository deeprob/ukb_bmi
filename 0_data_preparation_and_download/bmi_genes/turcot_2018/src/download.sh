# This is the site that Santhosh originally sent me, but the summary statistics they have here are not what we need. They are only SNPs, not gene name mappings. 

# I'm taking the genes directly from the paper that site cites: 
# Turcot V, Lu Y, Highland HM, Schurmann C, Justice AE, Fine RS, Bradfield JP, Esko T, Giri A, Graff M, Guo X, Hendricks AE, et al. (2018). Protein-altering variants associated with body mass index implicate pathways that control energy intake and expenditure in obesity. Nat Genet. 2018 Jan;50(1):26-41. doi: 10.1038/s41588-017-0011-x.
